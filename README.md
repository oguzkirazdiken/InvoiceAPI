# InvoiceAPI

In this project, I have created an RESTful web service that can store the Invoice and Contact information on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2-deutm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_emea_germany_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624524&adgroup=115749704783&gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hm9zKdGkvYYW893fru0AJFUi7a59PVdXMhFLSSXOr7HQ54r7sU8bqfRoCnUkQAvD_BwE) and suggest possible Contacts according to partial inputs.

API Views are developed on [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).The data models are provided with the help of [mongoengine](http://mongoengine.org/) connector.
